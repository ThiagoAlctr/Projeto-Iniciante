        <h1>Pretty Hurts</h1>
        <p>
            Ms. Third Ward, your first question<br>
            What is your aspiration in life?<br>
            Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be<br>
            To be happy<br>
            <br>
            Mama said: You're a pretty girl<br>
            What's in your head, it doesn't matter<br>
            Brush your hair, fix your teeth<br>
            What you wear is all that matters<br>
            <br>
            Just another stage<br>
            Pageant the pain away<br>
            This time I'm gonna take the crown<br>
            Without falling down, down, down<br>
            <br>
            Pretty hurts<br>
            We shine the light on whatever's worst<br>
            Perfection is a disease of a nation<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            Pretty hurts<br>
            We shine the light on whatever's worst<br>
            You're tryna fix something<br>
            But you can't fix what you can't see<br>
            It's the soul that needs a surgery<br>
            <br>
            Blonder hair, flat chest<br>
            TV says bigger is better<br>
            South beach, sugar free<br>
            Vogue says thinner is better<br>
            <br>
            Just another stage<br>
            Pageant the pain away<br>
            This time I'm gonna take the crown<br>
            Without falling down, down, down<br>
            <br>
            Pretty hurts<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            We shine the light on whatever's worst<br>
            Perfection is a disease of a nation<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            Pretty hurts<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            We shine the light on whatever's worst<br>
            You're tryna fix something<br>
            But you can't fix what you can't see<br>
            It's the soul that needs a surgery<br>
            <br>
            The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body<br>
            It's my soul, it's my soul that needs surgery<br>
            It's my soul that needs surgery<br>
            Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far<br>
            Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark<br>
            You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past<br>
            <br>
            Pretty hurts<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            We shine the light on whatever's worst<br>
            Perfection is a disease of a nation<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            Pretty hurts<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            We shine the light on whatever's worst<br>
            You're tryna fix something<br>
            But you can't fix what you can't see<br>
            It's the soul that needs a surgery<br>
            <br>
            When you're alone all by yourself<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            And you're lying in your bed<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            Reflection stares right into you<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            Are you happy with yourself?<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            You stripped away the masquerade<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            The illusion has been shed<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            Are you happy with yourself?<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            Are you happy with yourself?<br>
            (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)<br>
            <br>
            Yeah, yes<br>
            Ah-ah, ah<br>
            <br>
